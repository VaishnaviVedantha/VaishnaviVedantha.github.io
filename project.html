                    <p><strong>Tools and Software used:</strong> ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL Database, VS Code, GitHub</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>Developed a full-stack application using 3-tier architecture to manage 
                        student and faculty attendance efficiently. The application allows students to mark 
                        attendance by scanning QR codes, with subject-wise details displayed in real-time on 
                        the faculty dashboard. Adopted the Agile/Scrum methodology for development. 
                        The application extensively leveraged Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
                        concepts in the backend, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inheritance: Reused common logic across APIs to reduce redundancy.</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism: Enabled dynamic responses in API handlers for different types of users (students and faculty).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Tools and Software used:</strong> ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL Database, VS Code, GitHub</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>Developed a full-stack Faculty Recruitment Application using 3-tier 
                        architecture, comprising a presentation layer (ReactJS), business logic layer (Node.js), 
                        and data layer (MySQL). The application enables faculty to submit job applications to 
                        the institute seamlessly. Implemented secure and scalable RESTful APIs to handle 
                        data exchange between the frontend and backend efficiently. Adopted the Agile/Scrum 
                        methodology for development. 
                        Extensively utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inheritance: Reused shared logic across multiple classes, such as user roles 
                            (applicant, reviewer, admin).</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism: Enabled dynamic handling of methods like getDashboard() to 
                            return customized views for applicants and reviewers.</li>
                        <li>Abstraction: Simplified complex logic by exposing only the necessary details 
                            through well-designed API endpoints and hiding implementation details in the 
                            backend.</li>
